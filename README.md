This is the Github repository for Scratch's Smooth Saturday: David's Dimensional Rap Battle.
This is one of the official mirrors for the project, and others are unofficial unless stated. This also means that going through these hosters don't support the original project.

## Story


![David](https://github.com/480ScratchBlox/sssr-davids-dimensional-rap-battle/blob/main/docs/img/David.png)

Due to a random event that took place between the couple, they got immediately sent to the Frust dimension. After they were transported to this dimension, David spotted them in the distance. He was actually familiar with them and he wanted to rap battle them for time's sake. Maybe he will use his powers to bring you back to the 2D world if you rap battle him successfully.
